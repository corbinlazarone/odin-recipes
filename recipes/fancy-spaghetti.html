            </ul>

        <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large non-stick sauce pot, heat 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium high heat. Crumble ground beef into pot
                (approximately 1 inch pieces). Brown beef, stirring occasionally (I was alwasy taught to sir constantly but
                this makes your beef gray, let it brown on bottom and only stir occasionally) and breaking up beef as you stir,
                until cooked through. Drain ground beef, reserving 1 Tbsp fat in pot. Place browned beef in a food processor and pulse
                until finely ground, about 10-15 seconds, set aside.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Saute carrot and onion in reserved fat over medium high heat until golden, about 4 minutes, adding in garlic during the
                last minute of sauteing. Remove from heat (this will reduce splattering) and stir in 2 cans crushed Roma tomatoes, remaining 3 Tbsp extra
                virgin olive oil, basil, parsley, rosemary, thyme, oregano, marjoram, sage, bay leaves, salt, pepper, and browned beef.
                Return pot to low heat and simmer uncovered, 5-8 hours (yes minium of 5 hours), stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Add broth to sauce to thin sauce if desired (at about 4 hours sauce will be pretty thick so if you want it any thinner just add broth to 
                desired consistency. Also, once it reaches the thickness you want you can cover it with a lid to reduce further condensation). Remove bay leaves and serve sauce warm
                over pasta garnished with grated cheeses and additional chopped fresh parsley or basil if desired.
            </li>

        </ol>
